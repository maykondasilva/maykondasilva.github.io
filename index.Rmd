*This is the professional website of agronomist Maykon Junior da Silva. I grew up on a family farm in the South of Brazil. I did my undergraduate studies at Federal University of Santa Maria, majoring in Agronomic Engineering. Currently, I am a second year Master's Student in the Applied Plant Sciences Program in the Department of Agronomy and Plant Genetics at the University of Minnesota. I am a member of the Naeve lab, working with management strategies for iron deficiency chlorosis in soybeans. I am also the former treasurer of the APS Grad Club and part of the organizing committee for the Plant Sciences Symposium.*

*After graduation, I hope to work for an institution or industry in which I can help develop or improve technologies that will enhance crop performance and make food production more sustainable, be of use to solve real-world problems, and consequently benefit farmers and consumers. In my spare time, I greatly enjoy playing soccer, grilling, camping, and hanging out with my friends.*
